I was pleased to find out that a new version of [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter) has been released. New features including smart line wrapping, 100% standards compliance, additional themes and hosted versions of the source files. The documentation on the new wiki is also very good. It is obvious that [Alex Gorbatchev](http://www.sameshirteveryday.com/) has put a lot of effort into this release and should be commended. Below is a little “hello world” sample highlighted using the new version:

    using System;
    
    namespace HelloWorld
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// A "Hello World!" program in C#.
        /// </summary>
        class Hello 
        {
            /// <summary>
            /// The main entry point.
            /// </summary>
            static void Main() 
            {
                System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            }
        }
    }
