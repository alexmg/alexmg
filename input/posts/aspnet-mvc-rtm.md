It looks like [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) 1.0 has been released and is available for [download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=53289097-73ce-43bf-b6a6-35e00103cb4b&displaylang=en).

Microsoft have been very open with the development of MVC and have really taken community feedback on board. The end result of taking this transparent approach speaks for itself.

[Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/) from Microsoft has [written](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/03/18/aspnet-mvc-rtw.aspx) about the release of MVC and Iâ€™m sure [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) will soon roll out another one of his monster blog posts. It will be interesting to see what Microsoft has in store for the next version of MVC.
